The amount of water withdrawn for irrigation by far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in its distribution from its source to the crops. The term ``water requirement ratio'' (sometimes also called ``irrigation efficiency'') is used to indicate the ratio between the net irrigation water requirements or crop water requirements, which is the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the growing period of the crop, and the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation including the losses. In the specific case of paddy rice irrigation, additional water is needed for flooding to facilitate land preparation and for plant protection. In that case, irrigation water requirements are the sum of rainfall deficit and the water needed to flood paddy fields. At scheme level, water requirement ratio values can vary from less than 20 percent to more than 80 percent.\n",
